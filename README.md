### Features

- Command line and Electron app interfaces
- Interactive Nintendo Account login for the Nintendo Switch Online and Nintendo Switch Parental Controls apps
- Automated login to the Nintendo Switch Online app API
    - This uses splatnet2statink and flapg APIs by default.
    - Alternatively the imink API or a custom server can be used.
    - A custom server using a rooted Android device/emulator is included.
- Get Nintendo Switch account information, friends list and game-specific services
- Show Discord Rich Presence using your own or a friend's Nintendo Switch presence
    - Show your account's friend code (or a custom friend code)
    - Fetch presence from a custom URL
    - All titles are supported using a default Nintendo Switch app. A limited number of titles have their own
        Discord apps (meaning they appear under your name with the title's name instead of "Nintendo Switch")
        or other custom Discord features. [See here for Discord title overrides](src/discord/titles) or
        [create an issue if you'd like another title added](https://github.com/samuelthomas2774/nxapi/issues/new/choose).

    ![Screenshot showing Splatoon 2 as a Discord activity](resources/discord-activity.png)
- Show notifications for friend Nintendo Switch presences

    ![Screenshot showing a presence notification](resources/notification.png)
- [Electron app] Open game-specific services
    - Including NookLink, which doesn't work in web browsers as it requires custom JavaScript APIs.
- Nintendo Switch Online app API proxy server
    - This allows a single account to fetch presence for multiple users.
    - Data will be cached for a short time to reduce the number of requests to Nintendo's server.
    - This automatically handles authentication when given a Nintendo Account session token. This makes it much
        easier to access the API from a browser, in scripts or in other software.
- Download all personalised SplatNet 2 data, including battle and Salmon Run results
    - This supports monitoring the authenticated user's presence and only checking for new data when playing
        Splatoon 2 online.
- Download island newspapers from and send messages and reactions using NookLink
- Download all Nintendo Switch Parental Controls usage records

The API library and types are exported for use in JavaScript/TypeScript software. The app/commands properly cache access tokens and try to handle requests to appear as Nintendo's apps - if using nxapi as a library you will need to handle this yourself. [More information.](#usage-as-a-typescriptjavascript-library)

#### Electron app

nxapi includes an Electron app, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/samuelthomas2774/nxapi/releases). The app can be used to:

- Login to a Nintendo Account, both for the Nintendo Switch Online app and Parental Controls app.
    - This will open the Nintendo Account login page in the app, just like signing into Nintendo's own apps.
    - Accounts are shared with the nxapi command line interface.
- Share Nintendo Switch presence to Discord.
    - Using a custom presence URL or a friend's presence is supported.
    - Using the authenticated user's presence is not supported, as this is no longer available from the API ([#1](https://github.com/samuelthomas2774/nxapi/issues/1)).
- Showing notifications for friend presences.
    - Multiple users can be selected.
- Access game-specific services.
    - These will be opened in the app.

![Screenshot of the menu bar app with SplatNet 2 and NookLink open in the background](resources/menu-app.png)

The app includes the nxapi command line at `dist/bundle/cli-bundle.js`. Node.js must be installed separately to use this.

```sh
# macOS
node Nintendo\ Switch\ Online.app/Contents/Resources/app/dist/bundle/cli-bundle.js ...

# Windows
node 'Nintendo Switch Online/resources/app/dist/bundle/cli-bundle.js' ...
```

#### Do I need a Nintendo Switch Online membership?

No.

The only requirement to use this is that your Nintendo Account is linked to a Network Service Account, i.e. you've linked your Nintendo Account to a Nintendo Switch console at some point. It doesn't matter if your account is no longer linked to any console.

You will need to have had an online membership (free trial is ok) to use any game-specific services if you want to access those. SplatNet 2 can be used without an active membership, but NookLink and Smash World both require an active membership just to open them.

For Parental Controls data, you don't need to have linked your account to a console. You will need to use Nintendo's app to add a console to your account though, as this isn't supported in nxapi and the Parental Controls API is a bit useless without doing this.

#### Will my Nintendo Switch console be banned for using this?

No.

#### Will my Nintendo Account/Network Service Account be banned for using this?

It's extremely unlikely:

- Other projects (e.g. splatnet2statink, splatoon2.ink) have used the same reverse engineered APIs for a long time (pretty much since they've existed) and no one has ever been banned for using them. splatnet2statink in monitoring mode updates every 5 minutes by default - monitoring commands (Discord presence, friend notifications and SplatNet 2 monitoring) in nxapi only update slightly more frequently (every 1 minute), so there's not much higher risk than using splatnet2statink.
- Unlike console bans, account bans would prevent you from accessing digital content or online services you've paid for. (If your console was banned you'd still be able to use it and you could just buy another one to access your account.)
- Nintendo can't stop you watching their app's network activity, which is all the reverse engineering required to develop this.

For Discord Rich Presence, you can create an additional account, add your main account as a friend and use the `--friend-nsaid` option to avoid automating your main account. Once set up, you can remove the additional account from any console. You can also set up an API proxy server (with a HTTPS reverse proxy), authenticate using a separate account, and set up API proxy authentication tokens to allow up to 300 users (max. Nintendo Switch friends) to set up Discord Rich Presence (or, get their Nintendo Switch presence in a simple HTTP request to use for anything else) without any additional requests to Nintendo.

#### Why is a token sent to one/two different non-Nintendo servers?

It's required to generate some data to make Nintendo think you're using the real Nintendo Switch Online app, as currently it's too hard to do this locally. (This isn't required for Parental Controls data.) See the splatnet2statink and flapg section below for more information.

#### I need help using nxapi or Nintendo's APIs/I want to share something I've made using nxapi or Nintendo's APIs

I've created a Discord server for this project. Anyone interested in Nintendo's smart device app APIs is welcome to join, even if you're not interested in this project.

If you are creating something using Nintendo's smart device APIs: updates to Nintendo's apps are published in [#nintendo-app-versions](https://discord.com/channels/998657768594608138/998659415462916166).

#### API proxy server

Use this to access the Nintendo Switch Online app API from a browser/other HTTP client easily.

```sh
# Start the server listening on all interfaces on a random port
nxapi nso http-server

# Start the server listening on a specific address/port
# The `--listen` option can be used multiple times
nxapi nso http-server --listen "[::1]:12345"

# Use the API proxy server in other commands
nxapi nso ... --znc-proxy-url "http://[::1]:12345/api/znc"
ZNC_PROXY_URL=http://[::1]:12345/api/znc nxapi nso ...

# Start the server using another API proxy server
nxapi nso http-server --znc-proxy-url "http://[::1]:12345/api/znc"
ZNC_PROXY_URL=http://[::1]:12345/api/znc nxapi nso http-server

# Allow requests without a Nintendo Account session token
# Anyone connecting to the API proxy server will be able to use any already authenticated user with their Nintendo Account ID
# Don't set this if anyone can connect to the server!
nxapi nso http-server --listen "[::1]:12345" --no-require-token

# Limit the frequency of friends/announcements/web services requests to 60 seconds
nxapi nso http-server --update-interval 60

#### splatnet2statink and flapg

The splatnet2statink and flapg APIs are used by default to automate authenticating to the Nintendo Switch Online app's API and authenticating to web services. An access token (`id_token`) created by Nintendo must be sent to these APIs to generate some data that is required to authenticate the app. These APIs run the Nintendo Switch Online app in an Android emulator to generate this data. The access token sent includes some information about the authenticated Nintendo Account and can be used to authenticate to the Nintendo Switch Online app and web services.

Specifically, the tokens sent are JSON Web Tokens. The token sent to login to the app includes [this information and is valid for 15 minutes](https://gitlab.fancy.org.uk/samuel/nxapi/-/wikis/Nintendo-tokens#nintendo-account-id_token), and the token sent to login to web services includes [this information and is valid for two hours](https://gitlab.fancy.org.uk/samuel/nxapi/-/wikis/Nintendo-tokens#nintendo-switch-online-app-token).

Alternatively the [imink API](https://github.com/JoneWang/imink/wiki/imink-API-Documentation) can be used by setting the `NXAPI_ZNCA_API` environment variable to `imink`. (`NXAPI_ZNCA_API=imink nxapi nso ...`)

nxapi also includes a custom server using Frida on an Android device/emulator that can be used instead of these.

This is only required for Nintendo Switch Online app data. Nintendo Switch Parental Controls data can be fetched without sending an access token to a third-party API.

This is really annoying. Initially the Nintendo Switch Online app didn't perform any sort of client attestation at all, then Nintendo added a HMAC of the id_token, timestamp and request ID to app/web service login requests, using a secret key embedded in the app, which was soon discovered. Nintendo later updated the app to use a native library (`libvoip`, which is also used for the app's VoIP features) to do this, and still no one knows how it works. (To make things even more confusing, the function, `genAudioH`/`genAudioH2`, always returns a different result, even when given the same inputs.)

The reason Nintendo added this is probably to try and stop people automating access to their app's API. I really hope that's wrong though, as then Nintendo would be prioritising that over account security, as most people seem ok with sharing account credentials to access the API. (And it's not stopping anyone accessing the API outside of the app anyway.)

[**See #10 if you can help with this.**](https://github.com/samuelthomas2774/nxapi/discussions/10)

### SplatNet 2

All SplatNet 2 commands may automatically request a web service token. This will involve the splatnet2statink and flapg APIs (or a custom server). This can be disabled by setting `--no-auto-update-session`, however this will cause commands to fail if there isn't a valid SplatNet 2 token.

#### User

```sh
# Show the authenticated SplatNet 2 user
nxapi splatnet2 user
```

#### Download user records

```sh
# Download user records to the splatnet2 directory in nxapi's data path
# Data that already exists will not be redownloaded
nxapi splatnet2 dump-records
# Download user records to data/splatnet2
nxapi splatnet2 dump-records data/splatnet2
# Don't include user records (when downloading other data)
nxapi splatnet2 dump-records --no-user-records

# Include lifetime inkage challenge images
nxapi splatnet2 dump-records --challenges

# Include profile image (share button on the home page)
nxapi splatnet2 dump-records --profile-image
nxapi splatnet2 dump-records --profile-image --favourite-stage "Starfish Mainstage" --favourite-colour purple

# Download user records even if they already exist and haven't been updated
nxapi splatnet2 dump-records --no-new-records

# Include hero (Octo Canyon) records
# If this option is included hero records will always be downloaded even if they haven't been updated
nxapi splatnet2 dump-records --hero-records
# Only download hero records
nxapi splatnet2 dump-records --no-user-records --hero-records

# Include timeline (CPOD FM on the home page)
# If this option is included the timeline will always be downloaded even if it hasn't been updated
nxapi splatnet2 dump-records --timeline
# Only download the timeline
nxapi splatnet2 dump-records --no-user-records --timeline
```

#### Download battle/Salmon Run results

```sh
# Download battle and Salmon Run results to the splatnet2 directory in nxapi's data path
# Data that already exists will not be redownloaded
nxapi splatnet2 dump-results
# Download battle and Salmon Run results to data/splatnet2
nxapi splatnet2 dump-results data/splatnet2

# Include battle summary image (share button on the battles list)
nxapi splatnet2 dump-results --battle-summary-image

# Include battle result images (share button on the battle details page)
nxapi splatnet2 dump-results --battle-images

# Only download battle results
nxapi splatnet2 dump-results --no-coop
# Only download Salmon Run results
nxapi splatnet2 dump-results --no-battles

# Download summary data even if user records haven't been updated
# Individual battle results/images/Salmon Run results still won't be redownloaded if they exist
nxapi splatnet2 dump-results --no-check-updated
```

#### Monitor SplatNet 2 for new user records/battle/Salmon Run results

This will constantly check SplatNet 2 for new data.

```sh
# Watch for new battle and Salmon Run results and download them to the splatnet2 directory in nxapi's data path
nxapi splatnet2 monitor

# Watch for new battle and Salmon Run results and download them to data/splatnet2
nxapi splatnet2 monitor data/splatnet2

# Include profile image (share button on the home page)
nxapi splatnet2 monitor --profile-image
nxapi splatnet2 monitor --profile-image --favourite-stage "Starfish Mainstage" --favourite-colour purple

# Include battle summary image (share button on the battles list)
nxapi splatnet2 monitor --battle-summary-image

# Include battle result images (share button on the battle details page)
nxapi splatnet2 monitor --battle-images

# Only download battle results
nxapi splatnet2 monitor --no-coop
# Only download Salmon Run results
nxapi splatnet2 monitor --no-battles

# Set update interval to 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
nxapi splatnet2 monitor --update-interval 1800
```

SplatNet 2 monitoring can also be used with `nxapi nso notify` and `nxapi nso presence`. Data will only be downloaded from SplatNet 2 if the authenticated user is playing Splatoon 2 online.

This can be used with `nxapi nso presence --presence-url ...` (the presence URL must return the status of the user authenticating to SplatNet 2). When used with `--friend-nsaid` the friend's presence will be shared on Discord but the authenticated user's presence will still be used to check if SplatNet 2 data should be updated.

```sh
# Watch for new battle and Salmon Run results and download them to the splatnet2 directory in nxapi's data path
# All options support both the notify and presence commands
nxapi nso notify --splatnet2-monitor
nxapi nso presence --splatnet2-monitor

# Watch for new battle and Salmon Run results and download them to data/splatnet2
nxapi nso presence --splatnet2-monitor --splatnet2-monitor-directory data/splatnet2
nxapi nso presence --splatnet2-monitor --sn2-path data/splatnet2

# Include profile image (share button on the home page)
nxapi nso presence --splatnet2-monitor --splatnet2-monitor-profile-image
nxapi nso presence --splatnet2-monitor --sn2-profile-image

nxapi nso presence --splatnet2-monitor --splatnet2-monitor-profile-image --splatnet2-monitor-favourite-stage "Starfish Mainstage" --splatnet2-monitor-favourite-colour purple
nxapi nso presence --splatnet2-monitor --sn2-profile-image --sn2-favourite-stage "Starfish Mainstage" --sn2-favourite-colour purple

# Include battle summary image (share button on the battles list)
nxapi nso presence --splatnet2-monitor --splatnet2-monitor-battle-summary-image
nxapi nso presence --splatnet2-monitor --sn2-battle-summary-image

# Include battle result images (share button on the battle details page)
nxapi nso presence --splatnet2-monitor --splatnet2-monitor-battle-images
nxapi nso presence --splatnet2-monitor --sn2-battle-images

# Only download battle results
nxapi nso presence --splatnet2-monitor --no-splatnet2-monitor-coop
nxapi nso presence --splatnet2-monitor --no-sn2-coop
# Only download Salmon Run results
nxapi nso presence --splatnet2-monitor --no-splatnet2-monitor-battles
nxapi nso presence --splatnet2-monitor --no-sn2-battles

# Set update interval to 60 seconds
nxapi nso presence --splatnet2-monitor --splatnet2-monitor-update-interval 60
nxapi nso presence --splatnet2-monitor --sn2-update-interval 60
```

### NookLink

All NookLink commands may automatically request a web service token. This will involve the splatnet2statink and flapg APIs (or a custom server). This can be disabled by setting `--no-auto-update-session`, however this will cause commands to fail if there isn't a valid NookLink token.

#### Download summary data

```sh
# Download all daily and monthly summary data from all devices to the summaries directory in nxapi's data path
# Data that already exists will not be redownloaded
nxapi pctl dump-summaries

# Download all daily and monthly summary data from all devices to data/summaries
nxapi pctl dump-summaries data/summaries

# Download all daily and monthly summary data from a specific device
# Use `nxapi pctl devices` to get the device ID
# The `--device` option can be used multiple times
nxapi pctl dump-summaries --device 0123456789abcdef
```

### Misc. commands/options

#### Users

```sh
# Show all known Nintendo Accounts in a table
# This will only show cached data and does not make any requests to Nintendo servers
nxapi users list

# Use a specific user in a command
nxapi ... --user 0123456789abcdef
nxapi ... --token $NA_SESSION_TOKEN

# Set the default user for commands
nxapi users set 0123456789abcdef

# Remove all data for a user
nxapi users forget 0123456789abcdef
```

#### Electron app

When installing nxapi from source the app can be run using this command:

```sh
nxapi app
```

This command has no options, but environment variables can still be used.

#### Data location

Data will be stored in an OS-specific local data location by default in the `nxapi-nodejs` directory.

```sh
# Store data in ./data
nxapi --data-path ./data ...
NXAPI_DATA_PATH=`pwd`/data nxapi ...
```

#### Debug logs

Logging uses the `debug` package and can be controlled using the `DEBUG` environment variable. All nxapi logging uses the `nxapi`, `cli` and `app` namespaces.

```sh
# Show all debug logs from nxapi
DEBUG=nxapi:*,cli,cli:* nxapi ...

# Show all API requests
DEBUG=nxapi:api:* nxapi ...

# Show all debug logs
DEBUG=* nxapi ...
```

#### znca API server

A server for controlling the Nintendo Switch Online app on an Android device/emulator using Frida can be used instead of the splatnet2statink and flapg APIs.

This requires:

- adb is installed on the computer running nxapi
- The Android device is running adbd as root or a su-like command can be used to escalate to root
- The frida-server executable is located at `/data/local/tmp/frida-server` on the Android device
- The Nintendo Switch Online app is installed on the Android device

The Android device must be constantly reachable using ADB. The server will exit if the device is unreachable.

```sh
# Start the server using the ADB server "android.local:5555" listening on all interfaces on a random port
nxapi android-znca-api-server-frida android.local:5555

# Start the server listening on a specific address/port
# The `--listen` option can be used multiple times
nxapi android-znca-api-server-frida android.local:5555 --listen "[::1]:12345"

# Use a command to escalate to root to start frida-server and the Nintendo Switch Online app
# "{cmd}" will be replaced with the path to a temporary script in double quotes
nxapi android-znca-api-server-frida android.local:5555 --exec-command "/system/bin/su -c {cmd}"

# Specify a different location to the frida-server executable
nxapi android-znca-api-server-frida android.local:5555 --frida-server-path "/data/local/tmp/frida-server-15.1.17-android-arm"

# Make API requests using curl
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"type": "nso", "token": "...", "timestamp": "...", "uuid": "..."}' "http://[::1]:12345/api/znca/f"

# Use the znca API server in other commands
# This should be set when running any nso commands as the access token will be refreshed automatically when it expires
ZNCA_API_URL=http://[::1]:12345/api/znca nxapi nso ...
```

#### .env file

Some options can be set using environment variables. These can be stored in a `.env` file in the data location. Environment variables will be read from the `.env` file in the default location, then the `.env` file in `NXAPI_DATA_PATH` location. `.env` files will not be read from the location set in the `--data-path` option.

This can be used with the Electron app (including when using the packaged version).

#### User agent strings

As nxapi can be used in scripts or as a library, it exposes a few different methods for setting a user agent string for requests to the splatnet2statink, flapg, imink and other non-Nintendo APIs. You must include the name and version number of your script/program in the user agent. If your program is not open source or not easily discoverable (e.g. by searching GitHub) it must also include contact information.

When using the nxapi command in a script or other program, the `NXAPI_USER_AGENT` environment variable should be used. The `NXAPI_USER_AGENT` environment variable is only used by the nxapi command, and will be ignored by the Electron app or when using nxapi as a library.

```sh
NXAPI_USER_AGENT="your-script/1.0.0 (+https://github.com/...)" nxapi nso ...
```

When using nxapi as a TypeScript/JavaScript library, the `addUserAgent` function should be used.

```ts
import { addUserAgent } from 'nxapi';

addUserAgent('your-script/1.0.0 (+https://github.com/...)');

// This could also be read from a package.json file
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';
import { resolve } from 'node:path';
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises':
const pkg = JSON.parse(await readFile(resolve(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url), '..', 'package.json'), 'utf-8'));
addUserAgent(pkg.name + '/' + pkg.version + ' (+' + pkg.repository.url + ')');
```

#### Usage as a TypeScript/JavaScript library

nxapi exports it's API library and types. [See src/exports.](src/exports)

> You must set a user agent string using the `addUserAgent` function when using anything that contacts non-Nintendo APIs, such as the splatnet2statink API.

> Please read https://github.com/frozenpandaman/splatnet2statink/wiki/api-docs if you intend to share anything you create.

> nxapi uses native ECMAScript modules. nxapi also uses features like top-level await, so it cannot be converted to CommonJS using Rollup or similar. If you need to use nxapi from CommonJS modules or other module systems, use a [dynamic import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import).

> If you need any help using nxapi as a library [join the Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/4D82rFkXRv) or [create a discussion](https://github.com/samuelthomas2774/nxapi/discussions/new).

Example authenticating to the Nintendo Switch Online app:

> This is a simplified example of authenticating to the Coral API and using cached tokens. More logic is required to ensure you are using these APIs properly - [see src/common/auth/coral.ts for the authentication functions used in nxapi's CLI and Electron app](src/common/auth/coral.ts).

```ts
import { addUserAgent } from 'nxapi';
import CoralApi from 'nxapi/coral';

addUserAgent('your-script/1.0.0 (+https://github.com/...)');

declare function getCachedCoralToken(): [string, Date];
declare function setCachedCoralToken(token: string, expires_at: Date): void;
declare function getNintendoAccountSessionToken(): string;

let coral;

try {
    const [token, expires_at] = getCachedCoralToken();
    if (expires_at.getTime() > Date.now()) throw new Error('Token expired');

    coral = new CoralApi(token);
} catch (err) {
    const na_session_token = getNintendoAccountSessionToken();
    const {nso, data} = await CoralApi.createWithSessionToken(na_session_token);
    setCachedCoralToken(data.credential.accessToken, Date.now() + (data.credential.expiresIn * 1000));
    coral = nso;
}

const friends = await coral.getFriendList();
```

Example getting SplatNet 2 records:

> This example does not include authenticating to SplatNet 2. To benefit from the caching in the nxapi command, the `nxapi splatnet2 token --json` command can be used in most scripts. For example:
>
> ```sh
> # your-script.js can then read the iksm_session, unique player ID and region from `JSON.parse(process.env.SPLATNET_TOKEN)`
> SPLATNET_TOKEN=`nxapi splatnet2 token --json` node your-script.js
> ```

```ts
import SplatNet2Api from 'nxapi/splatnet2';

const iksm_session = '...';
const splatnet2 = new SplatNet2Api(iksm_session);

const records = await splatnet2.getRecords();
```
